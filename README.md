# IEEE

This repository contains code used for a variety of events, hackathons & classes conducted under the IEEE student chapter during 2018 - 2019.

## [Member Registration](https://github.com/niteshsrivats/IEEE/tree/master/Member%20Registration)

It contains scripts to faciliate the automated registration of new members (300 - 400) every year. Manual registration of a member can take up 8 minutes while the selenium script can do it in less than 1 minute (**8x - 10x improvement**).

## [Microsoft Technology Associate](https://github.com/niteshsrivats/IEEE/tree/master/Microsoft%20Technology%20Associate)

It contains code & scripts for the smooth conduction of the MTA program. It maintains details of attendees in various excel sheets and also a facility for **automatically sending mails** to the participants when these details are updated.

## [Rescue Mission Hackathon](https://github.com/niteshsrivats/IEEE/tree/master/Rescue%20Mission%20Hackathon)

It contains code for the conduction of the hackathon where the primary objective was to simulate and predict **asteroids that would collide with the Earth**. This repository contains the question as well as the solution for it.

## [Python SIG 2018](https://github.com/niteshsrivats/IEEE/tree/master/Python%20SIG)

It contains reference material for the **16 hour hands on course** on python taught to about 60 students. It contains cheatcheats and answers to some questions from global coding competitions such as IEEE Xtreme & Google Code Jam.

## [Machine Learning SIG 2019](https://github.com/niteshsrivats/IEEE/tree/master/Machine%20Learning%20SIG)

It contains reference material for the **12 hour hands on course** on machine learning taught to about 25 students. It contains class material on

- Gradient Descent
- Back Propagation
- Feed Forward Networks
- Convoluted Neural Networks
- Data Augmentation Techniques
- K Means Clustering Algorithm

## [Science of Deduction](https://github.com/niteshsrivats/IEEE/tree/master/Rescue%20Mission%20Hackathon)

It contains code for the creation of appropriate data for various puzzles to be solved in the Murder Mystery Event.
